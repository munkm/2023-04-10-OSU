## Computational Methods and Modeling in Nuclear Engineering
#### Madicken Munk

Seminar for the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at Oregon State
University
October 17, 2022

Computational tools are our first step to model, design, and study innovative nuclear 
technologies, eventually bringing these technologies to licensing and deployment. 
Each stage of computational tool development--from implementing numerical methods 
to modeling and analysis--has unique design requirements. This talk covers three 
facets of computational tools with descriptions of tools that belong to them. 
Each will be complemented by a discussion of how the tool both expands and 
provides limited insight into our data.
